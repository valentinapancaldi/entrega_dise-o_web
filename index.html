    <h1> Unplug to Recharge</h1>

    <h2> Our pointless custom jeopardizes our health and sleep quality.</h2>

    <h4> By Valentina Pancaldi</h4>

    <p> While we sleep, our phones serve no purpose and do not need to be right next to us all night. I'll share insights from the FDA, Harvard studies, and renowned doctors like Alex Dimitriu about the negative impact that having your phone nearby while you sleep can have on your health and sleep quality. I want to highlight the benefits of adopting a simple habit that requires little effort: <em>keeping your phone at a distance while you sleep.</em></p>

    <p>For those thinking, "I can't, I need my alarm," there are two very simple solutions. The first one is even more effective. Leave your phone in the bathroom so that when the alarm goes off, you'll still hear it, but you'll have to get up to turn it off. It's great—you'll never oversleep again. You'll stop hitting the snooze button and falling back asleep. And if you're feeling even braver, and leave your phone even further away in the living room or kitchen, I'll introduce you to a magical little box that solves the same problem: an alarm clock—the thing we used to set alarms with before cell phones.</p>

    <p>And if you're already in bed and would have to get up again to put your phone further away, I'll explain how trying to save yourself from getting up once can actually cost you more sleep and lead to poorer sleep quality.</p>

    <p> The key arguments are: </p> 
    <ol>
        <li> <strong>Health Risks of Radiation: </strong> Non-ionizing radiation from cell phones, though not conclusively linked to cancer, poses potential health risks. Long-term effects are still under study, with some research suggesting <strong>possible carcinogenic effects.</strong></li>

        <li><strong>Disruption of Sleep Quality: </strong>Blue light from phones <strong>reduces melatonin production</strong>, which disrupts sleep cycles. Even brief exposure can delay sleep onset and worsen sleep quality, with frequent night-time notifications further impairing rest.</li>

        <li><strong> Cognitive Stimulation: </strong>Cell phones keep the brain active with constant notifications, which can lead to adrenaline spikes and increased stress. This state of vigilance <strong>hinders the brain's ability to calm down and fall asleep.</strong></li>
    </ol>  

    <p>According to the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, there are two types of radiation. Ionizing radiation, which is high-energy and can cause serious health issues such as cancer, and non-ionizing radiation, which is lower-energy and is emitted by devices like cell phones. Currently, there is not enough scientific evidence to confirm that the radiation from cell phones causes health problems like ionizing radiation does. However, this does not mean it is harmless. The widespread use of cell phones is relatively recent, dating back about 25 years, so long-term effects are still being studied. A study by the U.S. National Toxicology Program made on rats found a clear association between exposure to this type of radiation and tumors in the heart and brain. As a result, the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified cell phone radiation as possibly carcinogenic, highlighting the need for further research on its long-term effects.</p>
        
    <p>In addition to potential health risks, sleeping near your phone affects your sleep quality in two main ways.</p>
        
    <p>Wesleyan University in Indiana states: "The blue light emitted by your phone threatens your sleep quality by reducing melatonin production, the hormone that regulates your wake and sleep cycles."</p>

    <p>During the day, exposure to natural blue light keeps us alert and productive. As the sun sets, our body starts producing melatonin to help us fall asleep. However, exposure to blue light from phones while trying to sleep, or during the night, inhibits melatonin production. It is as if every time you look at your phone, someone is saying to your body <em>it is not time to sleep!</em>. This not only makes it harder to fall asleep but also reduces the quality of your sleep. Wesleyan University also notes that even quick checks, like glancing at your phone to check the time or seeing a new notification, can have this effect. And waking up in the middle of the night due to a notification is particularly detrimental, with a Harvard study showing that 49% of the population experiences this frequently, and 16% do so more than once a night. According to the same study, college students lose an average of 46 minutes of sleep each night due to waking up to answer calls or messages.</p>
        
    <p>For restful sleep, the brain needs to reduce its activity and be calm. Cell phones, however, bombard the brain with information. The constant buzz of notifications keeps the brain active and alert. Each notification triggers a part of the nervous system, releasing a bit of adrenaline and putting the body on high alert. It can take up to 30 minutes for your body to return to a normal state after a notification. Moreover, even without notifications, having your phone nearby can put you in a state of vigilance, as your body remains on alert for potential notifications. According to the article “Phone Notifications Are Messing with Your Brain” from Discover, this can lead to stress and anxiety, making it harder to achieve the calm needed for sleep.</p>

    <strong>We are putting our health at great risk and worsening our sleep quality simply by not moving our phones a bit farther away during the times we do not use them.</strong>
